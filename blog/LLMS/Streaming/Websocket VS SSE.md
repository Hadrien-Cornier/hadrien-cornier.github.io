TLDR : For applications strictly requiring **server-to-client** communication with no need for client-to-server messages, **SSE might be the more efficient choice** due to its simplicity and lower overhead. However, if the application demands or might evolve to require **bi-directional communication**, **WebSockets could be a better choice** despite being slightly overkill for unidirectional scenarios



Server-Sent Events (SSE) and WebSockets are both technologies that allow for real-time, bi-directional communication between a client (typically a web browser) and a server, but they are designed for slightly different use cases and operate differently under the hood. Here's a comparison of their key characteristics:

### Server-Sent Events (SSE)

- **Direction**: SSE is a unidirectional protocol where updates are pushed from the server to the client. It's designed for scenarios where the client needs to receive updates or messages from the server in real-time, but the client does not need to send data back to the server, or does so only infrequently using standard HTTP requests.
- **Protocol**: SSE operates over standard HTTP. This makes it compatible with existing HTTP/2 infrastructure, including features like compression, header re-use, and request multiplexing, without needing a special protocol upgrade.
- **Reconnection**: SSE has built-in support for automatic reconnections. If the connection drops, the client will automatically try to reconnect after a timeout. Additionally, it supports event IDs to allow the client to request missed events after reconnection.
- **Ease of Use**: Implementing SSE is generally simpler than setting up WebSockets, especially on the server side, as it works over standard HTTP and can be easily routed, cached, and load-balanced with existing HTTP infrastructure.

### WebSockets

- **Direction**: WebSockets provide a full-duplex communication channel, allowing for bidirectional communication between the client and server. This is useful for interactive applications where the client and server frequently send data back and forth, such as in online gaming, chat applications, or live collaboration tools.
- **Protocol**: WebSockets use a distinct protocol that starts as an HTTP handshake (`Upgrade` request) but then switches to the WebSocket protocol for data transfer. This requires specific server-side support but allows for more efficient messaging after the initial handshake.
- **Reconnection**: WebSockets do not have built-in support for automatic reconnections or state synchronization after a dropout. Implementing robust reconnection and state synchronization logic is typically the responsibility of the developer.
- **Flexibility and Performance**: WebSockets are more flexible and can be more performant for high-frequency messaging and real-time applications, as they allow for lower overheads and latency once the initial connection is established.

### Choosing Between SSE and WebSockets

- **Use SSE when**: You need real-time updates from server to client in scenarios where the client does not frequently send data to the server. SSE is simpler to use and integrate into applications where the HTTP-based infrastructure (proxies, load balancers) is a significant consideration.
- **Use WebSockets when**: You need full-duplex communication for interactive applications where both the client and server frequently exchange data. WebSockets are more suitable for applications requiring high performance and low latency in both directions.

Both SSE and WebSockets are valuable technologies for building real-time web applications, and the choice between them depends on the specific requirements of the application, including the directionality of data flow, infrastructure compatibility, and performance needs.
