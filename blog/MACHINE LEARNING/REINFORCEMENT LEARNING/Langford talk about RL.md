All RL is about only three types of problems : 

- Generalization : You never see the SAME image twice and yet you can know how to answer
- Credit Assignment : You want to to know which actions are responsible for the reward
- Exploration : You want to maximize the amount of information that you learn about the world in order to help you solve the other problems
