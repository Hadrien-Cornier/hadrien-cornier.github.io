**Cyclomatic complexity** is a [software metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_metric "Software metric") used to indicate the [complexity of a program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_complexity "Programming complexity"). It is a quantitative measure of the number of linearly independent paths through a program's [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code "Source code"). It was developed by [Thomas J. McCabe, Sr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thomas_J._McCabe,_Sr.&action=edit&redlink=1 "Thomas J. McCabe, Sr. (page does not exist)") in 1976.

Cyclomatic complexity is computed using the [control-flow graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_graph "Control-flow graph") of the program: the nodes of the [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics) "Graph (discrete mathematics)") correspond to indivisible groups of commands of a program, and a [directed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph "Directed graph") edge connects two nodes if the second command might be executed immediately after the first command. Cyclomatic complexity may also be applied to individual [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(computer_science) "Function (computer science)"), [modules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming "Modular programming"), [methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_science) "Method (computer science)") or [classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_science) "Class (computer science)") within a program.

One [testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing "Software testing") strategy, called [basis path testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_path_testing "Basis path testing") by McCabe who first proposed it, is to test each linearly independent path through the program; in this case, the number of test cases will equal the cyclomatic complexity of the program.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity#cite_note-1)


Basically a measure of the complexity of a program in terms of the number of code paths that exists from entry to exit. If there are no If statements at all for instance the cyclomatic complexity is 1
