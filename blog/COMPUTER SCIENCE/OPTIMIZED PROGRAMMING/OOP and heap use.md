Would it be fair to say that creating an object in object oriented programming allocates the object on the heap ? Or if the object is created within a function, does it reside in the stack frame ?

In object-oriented programming (OOP), whether an object is allocated on the heap or the stack depends on how the object is created and the language being used. Let's break down the two main scenarios:

### Objects on the Stack

When an object is created within a function without using dynamic memory allocation (i.e., not using `new` in C++ or similar mechanisms in other languages), it resides on the stack. For example, in C++:

```cpp
void function() {
    MyClass object; // Object created on the stack
}
```

In this case, `object` is allocated on the stack frame of `function()`. Its lifetime is limited to the scope of the function: it is automatically constructed when the function is entered and destroyed when the function exits, invoking its destructor.

### Objects on the Heap

When an object is created using dynamic memory allocation (like with `new` in C++, or similar mechanisms in other languages), it is allocated on the heap:

```cpp
void function() {
    MyClass* object = new MyClass(); // Object created on the heap
    // Use the object...
    delete object; // The object must be manually deleted to free heap memory
}
```

In this scenario, the pointer `object` (storing the memory address of the allocated object) is on the stack, but the `MyClass` object itself is on the heap. The object's lifetime is not tied to the scope of the function; it persists until it is explicitly deallocated (with `delete` in C++).

### Language-Specific Behavior

Different programming languages manage memory in various ways:

- **C++**: As shown above, you control where objects are allocatedâ€”on the stack for automatic storage duration objects, or on the heap for dynamic storage duration objects.
- **Java/Python**: These languages tend to allocate all objects on the heap. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) or Python interpreter automatically manages memory allocation and garbage collection for you.
- **Rust**: Rust allows stack allocation and provides unique ownership and borrowing rules to ensure memory safety without needing a garbage collector. Objects can be explicitly allocated on the heap using smart pointers like `Box`.

### Summary

It's not universally true that creating an object in OOP always allocates it on the heap. It depends on how and where the object is created. Objects can be allocated on the stack if they are created as local variables within a function (in languages that support stack allocation like C++). In contrast, objects created with dynamic memory allocation mechanisms are stored on the heap, giving them a lifetime that can extend beyond the scope of the function in which they were created.
