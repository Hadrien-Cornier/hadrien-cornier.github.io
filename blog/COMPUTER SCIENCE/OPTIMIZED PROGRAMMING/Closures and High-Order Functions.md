Is there an inefficient copy step when a function calls another and passes in a value in the argument of the called function ? Do we have to physically write again the variable in the new frame of the stack trace ? Would it be fair to say that the stack trace pays for its memory leak safety by lower performance for sharing a data variable between functions?

When a function calls another function and passes a value as an argument, whether there's an "inefficient" copy step depends on several factors, including the size of the data, the programming language's conventions, and compiler optimizations. Let's break this down:

### Passing by Value vs. Passing by Reference

- **Passing by Value**: When you pass an argument by value to a function, the called function receives a copy of the argument. This does indeed involve writing the variable again in the new frame on the stack. For simple data types (like integers, floats, or characters), this operation is generally very efficient. However, for large structures or objects, passing by value can be more expensive in terms of both time (due to the copy operation) and space (due to the additional memory required on the stack).

- **Passing by Reference or Pointer**: Many languages allow passing arguments by reference or by pointer, which avoids copying the entire data structure. Instead, a reference or pointer to the original data is passed, which is much smaller than the data itself. This can be much more efficient for large data structures, but it requires careful management to avoid unintended side effects, as the called function can modify the original data.

### Compiler Optimizations

Compilers for languages like C and C++ are quite sophisticated and employ various optimizations to reduce the overhead of function calls, including:

- **Inline Expansion**: The compiler may choose to inline a function's body into the caller, eliminating the function call overhead altogether.
- **Copy Elision**: Compilers can sometimes eliminate unnecessary copies, even when passing by value, under certain conditions.

### Performance Considerations

It's not entirely fair to say that the stack trace "pays" for its memory safety with lower performance for sharing data between functions. While it's true that passing large objects by value can be inefficient, the alternatives (like passing by reference or using pointers) allow for efficient data sharing without unnecessary copying. Moreover, the stack's design favors fast allocation and deallocation for function calls and local variables, which generally enhances performance for typical usage patterns.

### Memory Safety and Performance

The stack's memory management model—automatic allocation and deallocation of frames—provides a significant safety advantage, preventing many common memory errors such as leaks and dangling pointers. This model does come with its constraints, but these are usually well-balanced with performance considerations. In cases where passing large amounts of data between functions is necessary, languages provide mechanisms (like references, pointers, or more complex data structures that may reside on the heap) to do so efficiently.

In summary, while there is a cost associated with passing data between functions, especially when done by value, programming languages and compilers offer various mechanisms and optimizations to manage these costs effectively. The choice between passing by value or by reference depends on the specific requirements of the function and the data involved, balancing the need for efficiency, safety, and simplicity.
