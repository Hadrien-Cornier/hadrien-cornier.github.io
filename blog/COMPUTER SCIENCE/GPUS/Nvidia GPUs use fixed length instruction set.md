Do the NVIDIA GPUS use the fixed length instruction set or the variable length ? I assume that greater scalability and ease of parallelism occurs when using fixed length. ?

NVIDIA GPUs use a fixed-length instruction set architecture. This design choice is particularly beneficial for the highly parallel computing environment of a GPU. NVIDIA's CUDA cores, for example, are designed to execute a large number of relatively simple instructions in parallel across many cores. A fixed-length instruction format simplifies the hardware design for instruction decoding and scheduling, which are critical for achieving high throughput in parallel processing.

A fixed-length instruction set enables several advantages in a GPU context:

1. **Parallel Decoding**: Because each instruction is the same size, multiple instructions can be decoded simultaneously and uniformly, which is ideal for the [[SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) nature of GPU processing]].

2. **Simplified Control Logic**: The control logic for fetching and decoding instructions is simpler with a fixed-length ISA, reducing the hardware overhead and leaving more room for data processing units.

3. **Predictable Performance**: The predictability of instruction processing time helps in scheduling and ensures consistent performance, which is essential for the workloads typically handled by GPUs, such as graphics rendering and scientific computations.

4. **Efficient Scheduling**: In GPU architectures, many threads are executing simultaneously. A fixed-length ISA makes it easier to schedule these threads and switch between them without incurring a significant performance penalty.

5. **Streamlined Pipelining**: Fixed-length instructions fit well into the pipelining strategies employed by GPUs, where different stages of instruction processing can be optimized for uniformity and speed.

While the parallelism in GPUs does benefit from a fixed-length ISA, it's also important to note that the types of calculations performed by GPUs tend to be different from those performed by general-purpose CPUs. GPUs are optimized for data-parallel tasks that perform the same operation on many data elements simultaneously, while CPUs are optimized for a wider range of tasks, including those that require more complex instruction sets.

NVIDIA's graphics and compute architectures, like their Turing and Ampere series, are optimized for the highly parallel and often repetitive computations that are typical in graphics rendering and general-purpose GPU (GPGPU) tasks. These tasks often leverage a fixed-length ISA for the reasons mentioned above, and NVIDIA's designs reflect this.
