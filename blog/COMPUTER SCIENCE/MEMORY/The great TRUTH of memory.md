the memory of a computer is the roughly the only place where there is a delay happening in a computer. 
Other logic gates are instantaneous... But
Are they ?

In digital circuits, both logic gates and memory units experience a delay known as propagation delay, which is the time it takes for a signal to travel through a component and produce an output. The delays in logic gates can vary from more than 10 nanoseconds to the picosecond range, depending on the technology used. The delay is influenced by various factors including the design and material of the semiconductor, the temperature, and the complexity of the circuit. The delays in memory units can be different as they often involve additional steps such as charging capacitors in dynamic RAM or setting and reading magnetic domains in storage devices.

The delay in a logic gate, also known as gate delay, is the time from when the input to the gate stabilizes to when the output stabilizes and is valid. This delay is intrinsic to the physical properties of the gate and the electronic characteristics of how the charge moves through the semiconductor. For example, the charge in a semiconductor can move at speeds varying roughly from 100,000 to 200,000 meters per second, depending on the material, and this contributes to the delay.

The speed of signal propagation in a logic gate is influenced by the logic family (e.g., transistor-transistor logic (TTL) or complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)) and is also subject to variability due to temperature and operating conditions. Propagation delay is a critical consideration in high-speed circuit design because it can lead to data errors or race conditions if not properly managed. It is a key factor in determining the processing speed of a processor.

In the context of computer memory, the delay can also be affected by the architecture of the memory, such as whether it's DRAM, SRAM, or some other form of memory technology. The access time in memory units is typically longer than the gate delay in logic gates because it often involves more complex operations.

In summary, while logic gates might seem instantaneous in their operation, they do have a small but significant propagation delay. Memory units, due to their complexity, typically have a larger delay compared to individual logic gates. However, the exact delay times will depend on the specific technology and materials used in the construction of the components【24†source】【25†source】【26†source】.

Let's delve deeper on this topic. Please go through the history of what main technological advances allowed us to get lower and lower propagation delays from the early days of computing to today.

The reduction of propagation delay in computing systems over the years can be traced through various technological advancements. Initially, the propagation delay was largely affected by the physical properties of the materials and the design limitations of the electronic components. Over time, as technology advanced, the materials used in semiconductors improved and allowed for faster charge movement, which in turn reduced the delay.

In the early days of computing, vacuum tubes were used, which were relatively slow and bulky. The invention of the transistor in 1947 by William Shockley, John Bardeen, and Walter Brattain of Bell Labs marked a significant advancement. Transistors were much smaller, faster, and more reliable than vacuum tubes, leading to a reduction in signal delay.

The progression from transistors led to integrated circuits (ICs) and the development of silicon-based semiconductor technology, which further reduced delays. As ICs evolved, so did the technology behind them, shifting from bipolar junction transistors to metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs), and eventually to complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. Each iteration brought about improvements in speed, efficiency, and the reduction of propagation delay.

The reduction of propagation delay is not just about the speed of individual components but also about the entire system's design. This includes the miniaturization of components, the increase in the density of circuits, and the improvement of the logic family designs. For example, the evolution from transistor-transistor logic (TTL) to CMOS technology allowed for significantly faster operation speeds and lower power consumption.

Advances in materials science have also played a role. The use of higher mobility materials for the construction of transistors and the refinement of silicon with fewer defects have contributed to faster electron transport and thus faster circuits.

Another factor is the design of circuits themselves, where the principle of logical effort is used to compare designs and optimize the propagation delays by considering the trade-offs between the complexity of the circuit and the speed at which it operates.

In terms of networking, the advent of fiber optics has greatly increased the speed at which signals can propagate, offering speeds about two-thirds that of light in a vacuum. This has drastically reduced latency in communications networks, allowing for the high-speed internet and data transfer capabilities we rely on today.

All these advancements have cumulatively contributed to the reduction of propagation delay in computing and communication systems, enabling the high-speed, high-performance computing environments that are now the backbone of modern technology and information exchange【34†source】【35†source】.
