[Excellent video showing the comparison side by side of assembly and a C program](https://www.youtube.com/@BenEater)


Example : an infinite loop is an unconditional jump


equality takes 2 instructions
add takes 3 instructions
print takes 4 instructions

Every instructions is stored in a specific memory address

#openQuestions
Challenge  : determine before hand all variables and give them an address offsetted by their type

How does setting up the stack frame work ? 

Why does equality require two lines in assembly >? WHy not one line ?  Why do we transit through the register ?

I am puzzled by this video which compares the output of a C program to its compiled assembly code and I want to know specifically why the equality assignment requires two lines of assembly instead of one ? Why do I have to go through the %esi "register" (I think it is a register) instead of moving y into x in one command ?

**$\quad$
The C code and its corresponding assembly code shown in the image are part of a program that calculates numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. The specific part you are asking about involves the equality assignment `x = y;`.

**In the C code, this is a straightforward assignment. However, in assembly language, the operation is performed in two steps:**

1. **`movl -0xc(%rbp), %esi` - This instruction moves the value from memory at address `rbp-12` (which corresponds to the variable `y` in the C code) into the register `%esi`.**
2. **`movl %esi, -0x8(%rbp)` - Then, the value in `%esi` is moved into the memory at address `rbp-8` (which corresponds to the variable `x`).**

**In x86 assembly language, there is typically no "move memory to memory" instruction. Most operations have to go through a register. Here `%esi` is used as an intermediary to transfer the value from one memory location to another. It's a two-step process because the architecture does not support moving data directly from one memory location to another in a single instruction. Instead, you have to move data from memory to a register, and then from the register to another memory location.**

**Registers are like temporary storage spaces in the CPU that are used to perform operations. They are much faster than memory access, so using them even as intermediaries can be beneficial for the speed of execution. The `%esi` register is just one of the general-purpose registers available for such tasks.**

**This is a common pattern in assembly language and reflects the lower-level operation of the CPU compared to high-level languages like C.**


But explain two things : 1) how would adding a step improve the speed ? and 2) why does the architecture not support memory to memory assignment ?

**Certainly, let's delve into these two questions:**

1. **How would adding a step improve speed?**
    
    **It might seem counterintuitive that adding a step could improve speed. However, the key to understanding this lies in the architecture of the CPU and the design of its instruction set. Modern CPUs are designed to be very fast at executing instructions that involve registers because they are located directly within the CPU, which allows for extremely quick access and operation.**
    
    **When an instruction is executed, it goes through several stages inside the CPU, such as fetch, decode, and execute. Register operations are typically handled in the execute stage without having to wait for slower memory operations. This means that while it takes two steps at the assembly level, each step is very fast because it uses the CPU's internal resources (registers).**
    
    **Moreover, CPUs are designed to do register operations concurrently (in parallel) with other operations. While one instruction is accessing memory, the CPU can be processing another instruction that only involves registers. This is a form of pipelining, which allows multiple instructions to be partially completed at the same time.**
    
2. **Why does the architecture not support memory to memory assignment?**
    
    **Direct memory-to-memory moves are not supported in many CPU architectures, including x86, due to a combination of historical and practical reasons:**
    
    - **Complexity: Memory-to-memory instructions would be complex to implement and would require additional circuitry within the CPU. This would make the CPU more complex, expensive, and potentially slower.**
        
    - **Efficiency: By using registers as intermediaries, the CPU can take advantage of fast register operations and pipelining, as explained above. This improves overall efficiency in executing sequences of instructions.**
        
    - **Historical reasons: When the x86 architecture was originally designed, memory was much slower relative to CPU speed than it is today. It made sense to minimize memory access and maximize the use of fast registers. This design decision has been carried forward for compatibility reasons, as the x86 architecture has evolved.**
        
    - **CISC vs. RISC: The x86 is a Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC) architecture, which traditionally aimed to reduce the number of instructions per program, expecting this to improve performance. However, this goal is better met by having a simpler set of instructions that can execute more quickly and be more easily optimized by compilers.**

**In summary, the use of registers as intermediaries for memory-to-memory data transfer is a design choice that balances complexity, efficiency, and performance. It is an inherent part of the x86 assembly language, reflecting the underlying hardware architecture and its historical development.**
