In [theoretical computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science "Theoretical computer science"), the **busy beaver game** aims at finding a terminating [program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program "Computer program") of a given size that produces the most output possible.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver#cite_note-rado-1) Since an [endlessly looping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endless_loop "Endless loop") program producing infinite output or running for infinite time is easily conceived, such programs are excluded from the game. This is sometimes also formulated as finding the machine that runs for the longest time, but both games are similarly difficult.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver#cite_note-2)

More precisely, the busy beaver game consists of designing a halting [Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine "Turing machine") with alphabet {0,1} which writes the most 1s on the tape, using only a given set of states. The rules for the 2-state game are as follows:

1. the machine must have at most two states in addition to the halting state, and
2. the tape initially contains 0s only.

A player should conceive a transition table aiming for the longest output of 1s on the tape while making sure the machine will halt eventually.

An **_n_th busy beaver**, **BB-_n_** or simply "busy beaver" is a Turing machine that wins the _n_-state busy beaver game. That is, it attains the largest number of 1s among all other possible _n_-state competing Turing machines. The [BB-2 Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver#Examples), for instance, achieves four 1s in six steps.

Deciding the number of 1s, or the running time, of the nth Busy Beaver is [incomputable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incomputable "Incomputable"). This has implications in [computability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability_theory "Computability theory"), the [halting problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem "Halting problem"), and [complexity theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory "Computational complexity theory"). The concept was first introduced by [Tibor Radó](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibor_Rad%C3%B3 "Tibor Radó") in his 1962 paper, "On Non-Computable Functions".[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver#cite_note-rado-1)





Explain the busy beaver problem and explain the solution for 2


	The busy beaver problem is a concept in computability theory that involves Turing machines. A Turing machine is a theoretical computational model that can use a predefined set of rules to operate on an infinite tape divided into cells, each of which can hold a symbol. The machine has a head that can read and write symbols to the tape and move the tape left or right, one cell at a time.

The "busy beaver" game involves designing a Turing machine that performs the following:

1. Starts in a designated initial state with an initially blank tape (all zeros).
2. Follows a set of rules to write ones and zeros on the tape.
3. Eventually halts after a finite number of steps.

The goal is to come up with a Turing machine that writes the maximum number of ones on the tape before halting, among all Turing machines with a certain number of states and symbols.

The busy beaver function `Σ(n)` is defined as the maximum number of ones that an n-state Turing machine can print before halting, when started on an empty tape. Determining the exact value of `Σ(n)` for arbitrary `n` is undecidable; it cannot be computed by a general algorithm due to the halting problem. In fact, the busy beaver function grows faster than any computable function.

For `n = 2` (meaning a Turing machine with two states), the busy beaver problem has been solved. The maximum number of ones that can be written by a 2-state, 2-symbol Turing machine before halting is four. This result was achieved by a Turing machine with the following state table:

```
State 0: (1, Right, State 1)
State 1: (1, Left, State 0)
```

Here's how the machine operates:

1. In State 0, write a 1 and move right, then transition to State 1.
2. In State 1, write a 1 and move left, then transition to State 0.

This machine will write a 1 and move back and forth, changing states each time. It will halt after four steps, with four ones on the tape, when it encounters the halt condition defined by the specific machine configuration. No other 2-state, 2-symbol machine can do better than this without running indefinitely, making it the "busy beaver" for `n = 2`.



why does it halt ?

The Busy Beaver Turing machine for two states and two symbols halts due to its specific set of transition rules. For the busy beaver problem, a Turing machine must eventually reach a halting state—a state for which there are no further instructions defined for the current tape symbol.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the transition table for the 2-state Busy Beaver Turing machine and why it halts:

```
State    Read    Write    Move    Next State
A        0       1        Right   B
A        1       1        Left    Halt (no transition defined)
B        0       1        Left    A
B        1       1        Right   Halt (no transition defined)
```

In this transition table:

- State A and symbol 0: Write 1, move right, go to state B.
- State B and symbol 0: Write 1, move left, go to state A.

When either state A or B reads a 1, there are no further instructions defined, which implicitly means the machine halts. The machine operates as follows:

1. Start in state A with a blank tape (all zeros).
2. Read 0, write 1, move right, transition to state B.
3. Read 0 (since the tape was initially blank), write 1, move left, transition to state A.
4. Read 1, and since there's no instruction for state A reading a 1, it halts.

The machine halts because it reaches a configuration where the current state and the symbol being read do not match any rule in the transition table. In the case of the 2-state Busy Beaver Turing machine, this happens after four steps, when it tries to execute an action in state A after reading the symbol 1. Since there is no rule for this situation, the machine halts. This is by design for this particular Busy Beaver problem, and it results in the machine producing the maximum number of 1s possible (which is four) for a 2-state Turing machine before halting.
