The logic engine is kind of a waste because the instruction is stored in 8bits but it can only perform 4 operations OR,AND,NOR,NAND which only requires 2 bits to enforce. The instruction could be in 2 bit arithmetic. Is there an architectural reason or tradeoff that explains why computers would not use a 2-bit instructed logic unit ? Or do they do that and and the game "turing complete" is teaching me an older less efficient way to create a logic gate on a chip ?

The screenshot you've provided seems to be from a logic simulation game called "Turing Complete," where the objective is to create a device that can perform different logical operations based on the given instructions. Regarding your question about the use of 8 bits to store an instruction that only requires 2 bits, this does touch on some real-world considerations in computer architecture.

In actual computer architecture, there are several reasons why you might not use a 2-bit instruction set even if you only have four operations:

1. **Extensibility**: Even if the current design only requires four operations, using an 8-bit instruction set allows for future expansion. The designers might anticipate adding more operations later on without needing to change the instruction set architecture.

2. **Uniformity**: Computers often use uniform instruction lengths to simplify the decoding logic. If every instruction is the same size, it's easier to fetch and decode instructions because the hardware doesn't need to handle variable-length instructions.

3. **Compatibility**: A standard instruction length can ensure compatibility across different systems or within different parts of the same system. This can be important for software portability and hardware interoperability.

4. **Speed and Simplicity**: Fixed-length instructions can make the hardware simpler and potentially faster because the hardware doesn't need to handle the complexity of decoding different instruction lengths.

5. **Coding Efficiency**: While using a full byte for a small instruction set may seem inefficient, it can actually be more efficient in terms of coding. It's much easier to work with byte-aligned data on most current systems, and the overhead of dealing with unaligned data can sometimes outweigh the savings from using smaller instructions.

6. **Memory Alignment**: Most modern processors are optimized for memory accesses that are aligned to certain byte boundaries. Using an 8-bit instruction set aligns with this architecture and can avoid penalties associated with unaligned memory accesses.

In the context of a game, the decision to use 8 bits might also be driven by pedagogical reasons. The game might be simplifying some aspects of logic design to make the concepts more accessible or to fit within the constraints of the game's mechanics.

In reality, most real-world computers use instruction sets that are much larger than 2 bits, typically 32 or 64 bits, and even more complex. This allows them to encode a wide range of operations, addressing modes, and operands. However, there are some specialized processors and microcontrollers that use very compact and efficient instruction sets, and these might use a smaller number of bits for certain operations.

The concept being illustrated in the game does have roots in historical and educational logic design, but in practice, modern computers are designed with a range of considerations that often favor larger instruction sets.
