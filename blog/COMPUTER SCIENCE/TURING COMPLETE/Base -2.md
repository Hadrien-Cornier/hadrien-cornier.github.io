ME : Can you explain what 1's complement versus 2s complement strategy in the early days of computing when it came to number format went the way it went ? Please explain the advantages and disadvantaged of both. Additionally I want some information on what base -2 would be for representing numbers ?

Certainly! Understanding 1's complement and 2's complement is crucial for grasping how computers represent negative numbers. Let's delve into both, including their advantages and disadvantages, and then explore the concept of base -2 representation.

### 1's Complement
**How it Works:**
- To find the 1's complement of a binary number, you simply invert all the bits (change 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s).

**Advantages:**
1. **Simple Concept:** It's straightforward and easy to understand.
2. **Easy to Implement:** In hardware, flipping bits is relatively simple.

**Disadvantages:**
1. **Two Representations for Zero:** There is a +0 and a -0, which can complicate arithmetic operations.
2. **End-Around Carry:** When adding numbers, an extra step is required to handle the carry bit.
3. **Inefficiency in Arithmetic:** More steps are required for addition and subtraction, impacting computational efficiency.

### 2's Complement
**How it Works:**
- The 2's complement of a binary number is obtained by taking the 1's complement and then adding 1 to the least significant bit (LSB).

**Advantages:**
1. **Single Zero Representation:** Eliminates the ambiguity of having +0 and -0.
2. **Simpler Arithmetic:** Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are more straightforward, as they don't require special handling of negative numbers.
3. **More Efficient:** Overall, it provides efficiency in arithmetic operations, especially on digital hardware.

**Disadvantages:**
1. **Slightly Complex Concept:** It's a bit less intuitive than 1's complement.
2. **Initial Learning Curve:** Understanding and implementing it might be slightly more complex at first.

### Why 2's Complement Became More Popular
2's complement eventually became the standard largely due to its efficiency in arithmetic operations and the fact that it has only one representation for zero. This simplifies many computational tasks and reduces the potential for errors in calculations, making it more suitable for computer operations.
