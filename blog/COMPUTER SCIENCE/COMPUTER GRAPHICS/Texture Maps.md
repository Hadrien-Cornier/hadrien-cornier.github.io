A texture map is a digital image applied to the surface of a 3D model to add color, detail, and texture, effectively enhancing the model's visual complexity without increasing its geometric complexity. Texture mapping is a fundamental technique in computer graphics used to add realism or artistic styles to 3D objects by wrapping 2D images around them.

Texture maps come in various forms, each serving different aspects of the rendering process:

1. **Diffuse Maps**: These are the most common type of texture map, representing the basic color or pattern of a surface. They define how the surface interacts with light in terms of absorbing and diffusing it.

2. **Specular Maps**: These control the shininess and reflectivity of a surface, determining how it reflects light. Specular maps are used to highlight specific areas that are more reflective, like metals or wet surfaces.

3. **Normal Maps**: Normal maps simulate small, detailed surface irregularities without actually altering the surface geometry. They contain information that changes the direction of light reflection to create the illusion of depth and texture detail on a flat surface.

4. **Bump Maps**: Similar to normal maps, bump maps create the illusion of depth on a surface by altering the surface normal during lighting calculations. They are grayscale images where the brightness of each pixel represents the height.

5. **Displacement Maps**: Unlike normal or bump maps that only simulate texture detail, displacement maps actually alter the geometry of the surface based on the map's values, adding real geometric detail.

6. **Opacity (or Alpha) Maps**: These maps control the transparency of different areas of a surface, allowing for the creation of complex shapes like foliage, hair, or transparent materials.

7. **Emissive Maps**: Emissive maps define areas of a texture that emit light, simulating materials like screens, neon lights, or glowing objects.

8. **Ambient Occlusion Maps**: These maps simulate the soft shadows that occur in corners and crevices of an object, adding depth and enhancing the perception of detail and realism.

Texture maps are created through various methods, including digital painting, photograph manipulation, or procedural generation. They are then mapped onto the 3D model using UV mapping, a process that involves unwrapping the 3D model into a 2D space to ensure the texture fits correctly on the model's surface. Texture mapping is a critical component in the fields of video game design, film animation, and architectural visualization, providing a means to achieve detailed and lifelike surfaces on 3D models.
