Rasterization is a fundamental process in computer graphics for converting vector graphics (such as 3D models and shapes defined by mathematical equations) into raster images (pixel-based images). This process is crucial for displaying three-dimensional graphics on two-dimensional screens, which are inherently pixel-based. Rasterization is widely used in various applications, including video games, simulations, and graphical user interfaces.

### How Rasterization Works:

1. **Conversion of Geometry**: The first step involves breaking down the geometric representations of 3D models (composed of vertices, edges, and polygons) into fragments or pixels that correspond to the final image. This process typically starts with transforming the vertices of 3D models from their model coordinates to screen coordinates.

2. **Scan Conversion**: This step involves determining which pixels of the screen correspond to each polygon (usually triangles) from the 3D model. It fills in the pixels (or screen space) covered by each polygon.

3. **Shading and Texturing**: After determining which pixels belong to which polygons, the rasterizer applies shading ([[Shaders]]) and texturing ([[Texture Maps]]) to these pixels. This step involves calculating the color and brightness of each pixel based on the light sources, material properties of the object, and texture maps, using algorithms like Phong shading or Gouraud shading.

4. **Z-Buffering**: To correctly render the depth of objects (which one is in front of the other), rasterization uses a Z-buffer [[Z-Buffering]] (or depth buffer). Each pixel's depth value is stored in the Z-buffer, and when multiple polygons project onto the same pixel, the one with the smallest depth value (closest to the viewer) is kept, while others are discarded.

5. **Final Image Composition**: The last step involves composing the final image from the processed pixels, applying any additional effects such as anti-aliasing to smooth out edges and improve visual quality.

### Characteristics of Rasterization:

- **Efficiency**: Rasterization is particularly efficient for real-time graphics rendering, such as in video games and interactive media, because it can be highly optimized and parallelized, especially on modern GPUs (Graphics Processing Units).

- **Limitations**: While rasterization is efficient, it has limitations in handling complex lighting phenomena like global illumination, reflections, and refractions, which are more accurately simulated by ray tracing. However, many real-time rendering engines combine rasterization with post-processing effects to simulate these complex effects more efficiently.

- **Hardware Acceleration**: Modern graphics hardware is specifically designed to perform rasterization very quickly, with specialized circuitry for tasks like texture mapping, Z-buffering, and shading.

Rasterization remains the backbone of real-time 3D graphics rendering due to its balance between performance and visual quality, enabling the creation of visually rich and interactive digital environments.
