A shader in computer graphics is a type of computer program that is used to perform shading, i.e., the production of appropriate levels of color within an image, or, in the modern era, also to produce special effects or do video post-processing. Shaders are written in a special shading language designed to be executed on graphics processing units (GPUs). Their main purpose is to calculate the visual appearance of an object or scene on a per-pixel or per-vertex basis in real time.

There are several types of shaders, each serving a different role in the graphics rendering pipeline:

1. **Vertex Shaders**: These operate on each vertex of a 3D model. Their main task is to transform the 3D coordinates of the vertices into a different space (typically screen space), to perform lighting calculations on the vertices, and to pass on per-vertex data (like color, texture coordinates) to the next stage in the pipeline.
    
2. **Fragment (or Pixel) Shaders**: These calculate the color and other attributes of each fragment (a potential pixel on the screen). They often perform complex calculations to simulate lighting, shadows, reflection, and other effects.
    
3. **Geometry Shaders**: Operating on entire primitives (such as triangles, lines, points), geometry shaders can modify, discard, or produce additional vertices to create new shapes or effects. They are less commonly used than vertex and fragment shaders due to their performance implications.
    
4. **Tessellation Shaders**: These are involved in the tessellation process, which subdivides shapes into finer geometric forms, allowing for more detailed rendering. They consist of two parts: the tessellation control shaders (TCS) which handle how much tessellation to apply to a patch of vertices, and the tessellation evaluation shaders (TES) which compute the final position of the tessellated vertices.
    
5. **Compute Shaders**: These are more general-purpose shaders not directly tied to rendering. They are used for offloading complex computation to the GPU that doesn't necessarily involve drawing to the screen, such as physics simulations or advanced post-processing effects.
    

Shaders are a powerful tool in computer graphics, allowing developers and artists to achieve a wide range of visual effects and optimizations by running custom code on the GPU. Their flexibility and efficiency have made them a cornerstone of modern 3D graphics, video games, and visual effects software.

Shader programming has become a fundamental aspect of modern video games, enabling developers to achieve realistic, stylized, or complex visual effects that enhance gameplay and immersion. Below is a list of notable shader programs, the video games that use them, their complexity, operational insights, and the shader family they represent:

1. **[[PBR  - Physically based rendering]]**
   - **Games**: "Unreal Engine 4 & 5 games" (e.g., "Fortnite"), "Unity Engine games" (e.g., "Ori and the Will of the Wisps"), "God of War", "Spider-Man"
   - **Complexity**: High. Understanding PBR shaders requires knowledge of physical lighting models, material properties, and how they interact with light.
   - **How They Work**: PBR shaders simulate the way light interacts with surfaces in the real world, using complex mathematical models to accurately represent materials like metals, wood, glass, etc. They often involve multiple passes and calculations for reflection, refraction, and scattering of light.
   - **Shader Family**: Fragment/Pixel Shaders.

2. **[[Deferred Shading]] Shaders**
   - **Games**: "Grand Theft Auto V", "DOOM", "The Witcher 3"
   - **Complexity**: High. Deferred shading involves multiple rendering passes and a good understanding of the rendering pipeline.
   - **How They Work**: Deferred shading shaders separate the rendering process into two major phases. The first phase collects data about each pixel's geometry and material properties. The second phase calculates lighting for each pixel independently, allowing for a large number of light sources to be rendered efficiently.
   - **Shader Family**: Usually involves Vertex and Fragment Shaders, with some Geometry Shader use for light volume optimizations.

3. **Toon/Cel Shading Shaders**
   - **Games**: "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild", "Borderlands", "Jet Set Radio"
   - **Complexity**: Medium. Toon shading is more stylized and less physically accurate, which can simplify some aspects but also requires artistic finesse.
   - **How They Work**: Toon shaders often use a stepped color gradient or edge detection to create a hand-drawn, cartoon-like appearance. Lighting calculations are simplified and stylized, with hard boundaries between light and dark areas.
   - **Shader Family**: Fragment/Pixel Shaders, sometimes with Vertex Shaders for edge detection enhancements.

4. **Water Shaders**
   - **Games**: "Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag", "Sea of Thieves", "Crysis"
   - **Complexity**: High. Water shaders involve complex simulations of light scattering, reflection, refraction, and wave physics.
   - **How They Work**: These shaders simulate the dynamic, translucent properties of water, including ripples, waves, foam, and reflections. They often involve complex mathematical models to simulate fluid dynamics and optical effects.
   - **Shader Family**: Fragment/Pixel Shaders, with Vertex and Tessellation Shaders for wave simulations and surface tessellation.

5. **Post-Processing Shaders** (Bloom, Depth of Field, Motion Blur)
   - **Games**: "Uncharted 4", "Red Dead Redemption 2", "God of War"
   - **Complexity**: Medium to High. The complexity can vary significantly depending on the effect and its integration into the engine's rendering pipeline.
   - **How They Work**: These shaders are applied after the scene has been rendered to enhance visual quality or achieve specific effects. For example, bloom shaders simulate light diffusion around bright areas, depth of field shaders blur parts of the scene based on distance from the focus point, and motion blur shaders create a blur effect on moving objects.
   - **Shader Family**: Post-processing shaders are generally Fragment/Pixel Shaders applied to the rendered image.

Learning and working with shaders can range from moderately challenging to highly complex, depending on the desired effect and the level of realism or stylization. Understanding the basics of shader programming and graphics rendering is essential, and proficiency in a shading language like HLSL (High-Level Shading Language) or GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) is required. The complexity of learning these shaders also depends on one's familiarity with the underlying mathematical concepts, like vector and matrix mathematics, lighting models, and the graphics pipeline.
