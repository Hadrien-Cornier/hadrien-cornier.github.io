In the context of computer graphics and 3D modeling, "albedo" refers to the diffuse reflectivity or reflecting power of a surface. It is a term borrowed from physics and astronomy, where it originally described the diffuse reflection of sunlight without spectral dependence. In graphics, it's used to define the base color of a material without considering the influence of direct light or shadow.

Albedo is an essential component of physically based rendering (PBR) workflows, which aim to simulate the interaction between materials and light in a realistic manner. In PBR, the albedo value represents the color of the material under neutral lighting conditions (white light). It's typically provided as a color map or texture that defines the color and intensity of the light that is scattered back when light hits the surface of the object.

### Key Points about Albedo in Computer Graphics:

- **Color Representation**: Albedo textures are usually stored in RGB format, where each pixel represents the color of the surface at that point.

- **Non-Light-Interacting Properties**: Albedo does not account for any lighting effects such as specularity, reflections, or shadows. It purely represents the "raw" color of the material.

- **Physically Based Rendering (PBR)**: In PBR, materials are often defined by a set of textures including albedo, metallic, roughness, and normal maps, among others. The albedo map plays a crucial role in giving materials their characteristic appearance.

- **Energy Conservation**: In PBR, the concept of energy conservation is important, and albedo values are used to ensure that the surface does not reflect more light than it receives. This means albedo values are typically kept below a certain threshold to maintain physical realism.

- **Use in Shading**: During the shading process, the albedo value is combined with lighting calculations to determine the final color of a pixel on the rendered image. This involves calculating how light interacts with the material's surface properties, including its albedo.

In essence, the albedo map is used to convey the base color and texture of a 3D object, which is then integrated with other material properties and lighting conditions to produce the final rendered image. It's a critical factor in achieving realistic or stylized looks in digital content creation, including video games, movies, and simulations.
