Z-buffering, also known as depth buffering, is a computer graphics technique used in [[Rasterization]] to manage image depth coordinates in 3D graphics. This technique is essential for ensuring that the correct elements are rendered in front when objects overlap or intersect from the viewer's perspective, effectively solving the "hidden surface" problem.

### How Z-Buffering Works:

1. **Depth Value Storage**: In z-buffering, each pixel on the screen has a corresponding z-value stored in the z-buffer (a separate memory area). This value represents the distance from the viewer (or camera) to the object's surface that is projected onto that pixel. Initially, the z-buffer is filled with a maximum depth value, often corresponding to the farthest possible point in the scene.

2. **Rendering Process**: As each polygon in the scene is processed during rasterization, the depth (z-value) of the polygon at each pixel it covers is compared to the corresponding value currently stored in the z-buffer.

3. **Depth Comparison**: If the polygon's depth at a specific pixel is less than (closer than) the stored value in the z-buffer for that pixel, the pixel's color and depth value are updated with the new values from the polygon. If the polygon's depth is greater (further away), the pixel is not updated, effectively discarding the part of the polygon that is behind other geometry from the viewer's perspective.

4. **Final Image**: After all polygons have been processed, the z-buffer contains the depth values of the nearest surfaces at each pixel, and the frame buffer (which stores the pixel colors) contains the final image as seen from the camera's perspective, with correctly rendered depth.

### Characteristics and Advantages of Z-Buffering:

- **Simplicity and Universality**: The z-buffering algorithm is straightforward to implement and is universally supported by graphics hardware, making it a standard technique in real-time rendering.

- **Memory Intensive**: While z-buffering is efficient in terms of computational complexity, it can be memory-intensive since it requires storing a depth value for every pixel on the screen.

- **Accuracy**: Z-buffering provides a high degree of accuracy in depth comparisons, ensuring that surfaces are rendered correctly in relation to each other.

### Limitations:

- **Overdraw**: Z-buffering can lead to overdraw, where pixels are processed multiple times before determining the final visible surface, which can be inefficient, especially for complex scenes with many overlapping objects.

- **Transparency Issues**: Handling transparent objects with z-buffering can be challenging because transparent surfaces can reveal objects behind them, complicating simple depth comparisons.

Z-buffering remains a foundational technique in 3D graphics rendering, used extensively in video games, simulations, and any application that requires realistic 3D visualization. Its effectiveness in solving the hidden surface problem, combined with hardware support, ensures its continued use in both real-time and offline rendering pipelines.
