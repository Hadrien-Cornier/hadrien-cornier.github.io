Is the fact that you have to write  **`end`** to close a while loop, is it a concession to compiler or is it to prevent infinite loops ?

The requirement to explicitly close a `while` loop (or any other control structure like `if`, `for`, etc.) with an `end` statement, as seen in languages like MATLAB or Julia, serves several purposes, but it's primarily about clarity and structure in the code, rather than a concession to the compiler or a measure to prevent infinite loops. Here's how it functions:

1. **Clarity and Readability**: The explicit `end` statement clearly defines where a control structure ends. This can make the code more readable, especially in cases where there are nested loops or conditional statements. Without such clear demarcation, it can become difficult to discern the scope and extent of each control structure.

2. **Structural Organization**: In languages that use indentation (like Python) to define the scope of loops and conditionals, the structure of the code is visually apparent. However, in languages that do not rely on indentation in this way (like MATLAB or Julia), the `end` statement provides a necessary structural boundary. It helps in organizing the code and understanding the flow of control.

3. **Compiler/Interpreter Design**: From a language design perspective, the `end` statement simplifies the parsing of the code. When a compiler or interpreter reads the code, `end` statements provide clear markers, helping in correctly constructing the program's control flow. This isn't necessarily a concession but rather a design choice that influences how the language is parsed and executed.

4. **Preventing Infinite Loops**: The presence of an `end` statement does not inherently prevent infinite loops. Infinite loops occur when the loop's termination condition is never met, and they can happen regardless of whether the language uses `end` statements. To prevent infinite loops, the programmer must ensure that the loop's condition will eventually become false (or true, depending on the loop type).

In summary, the use of an `end` statement in some programming languages is mainly about providing clarity and structure to the code, aiding both the programmer in understanding the code and the compiler/interpreter in processing it. The choice of whether to use such statements or rely on indentation (or other means) to denote code blocks is a fundamental aspect of a programming language's design and syntax.
