The assertion that object-oriented programming (OOP) makes it easier to manage large codebases with many contributors is widely held, but it's important to understand that this is more a matter of convention and tooling than an inherent quality of the OOP paradigm itself. Here's a deeper look at why OOP is often seen as beneficial for large-scale projects:

1. **Modularity**: OOP encourages modularity through the use of classes and objects. This means that large systems can be broken down into smaller, more manageable components (objects), each encapsulating its own data and behavior. This modularity helps in organizing and structuring the code, making it easier for multiple developers to work on different parts of the system without causing conflicts.

2. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation allows for hiding the internal state of an object and exposing only what is necessary through a well-defined interface. This reduces the complexity for other developers, as they can use objects without needing to understand the intricate details of their internal workings.

3. **Code Reusability**: OOP facilitates code reuse through inheritance and polymorphism. Once a class is written, it can be used as the basis for other classes, avoiding code duplication. This can be particularly helpful in large projects, where similar patterns and functionalities are common.

4. **Maintenance and Scalability**: OOP makes it easier to maintain and scale large codebases. Since changes to a class are localized to that class, they are less likely to have unexpected effects elsewhere in the system. This containment of effects is crucial in large projects where changes are frequent.

5. **Design Patterns and Best Practices**: OOP has a rich set of design patterns and best practices that have been developed over time, which provide proven solutions to common design problems. This shared knowledge base can be very helpful in coordinating the efforts of many developers.

However, it's important to note that other programming paradigms, such as functional programming or procedural programming, can also be effective in managing large codebases, depending on the context:

- **Functional Programming**: Languages like Haskell or Scala emphasize immutability and pure functions, which can lead to more predictable and testable code. For certain types of applications, particularly those involving complex concurrency or requiring high reliability, this can be advantageous.

- **Procedural Programming**: In some scenarios, particularly in systems programming or when working close to the hardware, a procedural style (like that used in C) can be more straightforward and efficient.

- **Mixed Paradigms**: Many modern languages support multiple paradigms, allowing developers to choose the most suitable approach for each part of their application. For instance, Python and JavaScript support both OOP and functional programming concepts.

In conclusion, while OOP is indeed popular and widely used for large-scale software development, its effectiveness depends on how well its principles are applied and on the nature of the specific project. The choice of programming paradigm should be guided by the project's requirements, the team's expertise, and the specific challenges of the domain.
