Q: What does it mean for Vue.js to be a progressive javascript framework ? What is a non progressive framework ? ?


<span style="font-family:Optima-Regular;">The term "progressive framework" refers to Vue.js's design philosophy, which aims to be incrementally adoptable. The core library focuses on the view layer only, and it's easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications (SPAs) when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.</span>

<span style="font-family:Optima-Regular;">Here's a breakdown of what makes Vue.js progressive:</span>

<span style="font-family:Optima-Regular;">1. **Adoptable in Different Scales:** You can use Vue for a small part of a page (like jQuery) or scale it up for full-blown SPAs.</span>

<span style="font-family:Optima-Regular;">2. **Layered Adoption:** You can start with the core library, and if you need more features, you can adopt Vue Router for SPA navigation, Vuex for state management, and Vue CLI for a full development environment.</span>

<span style="font-family:Optima-Regular;">3. **Ease of Integration:** Vue.js can be dropped into a project to enhance parts of it without the need for a full rewrite.</span>

<span style="font-family:Optima-Regular;">4. **Flexibility:** Developers have the flexibility to structure their app as they see fit. Vue's ecosystem is adaptable to the developer's needs.</span>

<span style="font-family:Optima-Regular;">5. **Rich Ecosystem:** Despite its progressive nature, Vue has a rich ecosystem that supports complex applications with routing, state management, and build tooling.</span>

<span style="font-family:Optima-Regular;">In contrast, a "non-progressive" framework might be one that is more opinionated and requires buying into the entire ecosystem from the start. These frameworks often have a more rigid set of guidelines and a steeper learning curve because you're required to use a specific set of tools and practices defined by the framework. They might not be as easy to incrementally introduce into an existing codebase. Examples might include frameworks like Angular, which is often seen as a full-featured, enterprise-level framework.</span>

<span style="font-family:Optima-Regular;">In summary, Vue.js's progressive nature means it can be adopted gradually, piece by piece, without needing a complete overhaul of your project. It is designed to be as flexible and modular as the developer's particular use case requires.</span>
