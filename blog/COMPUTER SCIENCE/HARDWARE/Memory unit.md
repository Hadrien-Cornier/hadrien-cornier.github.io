The main core of the memory is the time gate that allows to retain information over one cycle : ie using a switch gate and a delay gate we create a memory of 1 time unit and then using composition and switch gates we turn that into the RAM


I assume the time gate is probably implemented with a capacitor that takes one cycle to fill up or empty up. Or probably even more than that for safety

Essentially the clcok speed of computers is limited by how fast we can make this capacitor empty itself.

I assume that the smaller the components get, the higher the achievable clock speed because these capacitor time delay units will fill up and empty faster

Is that correct ?

Your understanding touches on several important aspects of computer memory and processing speed, but it simplifies some complex engineering and physical principles. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Memory Core and Time Gates**: In digital circuits, memory is typically implemented using flip-flops or latches, which are made from transistors and capacitors. The concept of a "time gate" isn't a standard term in electronics, but it seems like you're referring to the ability of these circuits to hold information over a cycle. This is more about the stable states of a flip-flop or latch rather than a specific "time gate."

2. **Capacitors in Memory and Processing**: Capacitors are indeed used in memory technology, particularly in dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), where each memory cell consists of a capacitor and a transistor. The capacitor holds the bit of information as a charge. However, the primary challenge in memory technology is not just about the charging and discharging speed of capacitors but also about maintaining data integrity, minimizing leakage, and dealing with issues like refresh requirements in DRAM.

3. **Clock Speed and Capacitors**: The clock speed of a computer is influenced by how quickly its components can switch states, but it's not solely dependent on the charge/discharge rate of capacitors. [[Transistor switching speeds]], [[Interconnect delays]], heat dissipation, power consumption, and other factors also play crucial roles. As components get smaller (following Moore's Law), we can indeed increase clock speeds to some extent, but there are physical limits to how small components can get and how fast they can operate.

4. **Limits of Miniaturization and Speed**: As we miniaturize components, other issues like [[Quantum tunneling]], heat dissipation, and [[Electromigration]] become more significant. These issues present fundamental physical limits to how fast we can switch transistors on and off and how densely we can pack them on a chip. Additionally, the speed of light itself imposes limits on signal propagation times in circuits.

In summary, while smaller component sizes can lead to higher clock speeds due to faster switching transistors and shorter electrical paths, the relationship isn't as direct as simply the charge/discharge rate of capacitors. Modern computer architectures have to balance a complex array of factors to optimize performance, and advancements often come from innovative designs and materials rather than just scaling down existing technologies.
