numbers from 0-9 + A + B + C + D + E + F
represents 4-bits

A 32 bit number can be represented as 

A2 B6 3F 12

(each character is 4 bits, so we have $4*2*4=32$ bits 
represented above)



ARM 64-bits system still uses 32 bits for numbers (32=word 16=half-word 32=word 64=doubleworld)


So a double is 64bits=8bytes a float is 32bits=4bytes on a 64bit ARM

in assembler we but 0x in front of a hexadecimal number
