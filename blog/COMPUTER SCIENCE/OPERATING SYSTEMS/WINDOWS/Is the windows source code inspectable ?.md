Has it been leaked ? 

DO we know what core design decisions have led to Linux being the superior distribution today ? 


The Windows source code has seen several leaks over the years, but it's important to note that the source code of Windows, as a proprietary software, is not openly inspectable under normal circumstances.

In June 2017, there was a significant leak where over 32TB of Windows 10 internal builds and some parts of the operating system's source code were uploaded online. This leak included private internal builds for the then-upcoming version of Windows 10, codenamed Redstone 3, and was only meant for internal use by Microsoft employees. The leaked source code was part of [[Microsoft's Shared Source Kit]] program, which meant that most of it was already available online, but there was a concern that new, sensitive source code might have been included in the leak. This posed a security risk as it could potentially allow attackers to identify vulnerabilities in Windows 10 releases ahead of time.



From a [quick search](https://chat.openai.com/backend-api/bing/redirect?query=Linux%20vs%20Windows%20kernel%20design%20differences), here's what I discovered.

The differences between the Windows and Linux kernels can be broadly categorized into aspects like their architecture, accessibility, GUI handling, and support for multi-users. These differences reflect the core design decisions made by the developers of these operating systems.

1. **Architecture**: The Windows kernel is known as a hybrid kernel, while the Linux kernel has a monolithic architecture. The hybrid kernel in Windows supports both uniprocessor and symmetrical multiprocessor-based computers. It consists of the kernel, hardware abstraction layer (HAL), drivers, and other supporting services. In contrast, the Linux kernel, being monolithic, integrates all kernel-related functions directly into one layer, offering a more unified and potentially efficient architecture.

2. **Source Code Accessibility**: Windows kernel, as a part of a commercial operating system developed by Microsoft, does not provide public access to its source code. On the other hand, the Linux kernel is open-source, which means its source code is freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute.

3. **File Access Control**: Windows employs an Access Control List (ACL) for file access control, whereas Linux uses traditional Unix permissions and POSIX ACL. This difference impacts how file permissions and user access are managed in each system.

4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI) Stack**: In Windows, the GUI stack is included in the kernel, which integrates graphical functions more closely with the operating system core. Conversely, in Linux, the GUI stack is kept in the user-space, which can offer more flexibility and modularity.

5. **Multi-user Support**: The Windows kernel supports multiple users and sessions, but this can vary depending on the version and edition of the operating system. Linux, being based on Unix, inherently supports a multi-user environment, making it a strong candidate for server and network environments.

6. **Configuration Storage**: Windows stores its system configurations in a registry database, whereas Linux stores its configurations in files. This reflects a fundamental difference in how each system approaches configuration management.

7. **Device Handling**: The Windows kernel treats different devices variably through a mechanism, whereas in Linux, all devices are treated uniformly as files. This aspect of Linux is rooted in the Unix philosophy of “everything is a file,” simplifying the interaction with hardware.

These differences highlight that while Windows is often seen as more user-friendly and suitable for a broad range of commercial applications, Linux offers greater flexibility, openness, and configurability, making it popular among developers and in server environments【34†source】【35†source】【36†source】.
