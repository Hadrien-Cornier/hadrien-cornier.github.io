In [numerical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis "Numerical analysis"), a **root-finding algorithm** is an [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") for finding [zeros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_of_a_function "Zero of a function"), also called "roots", of [continuous functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function"). A [zero of a function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_of_a_function "Zero of a function") _f_, from the [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number) to real numbers or from the [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number") to the complex numbers, is a number _x_ such that _f_(_x_) = 0. As, generally, the zeros of a function cannot be computed exactly nor expressed in [closed form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_form_expression "Closed form expression"), root-finding algorithms provide approximations to zeros, expressed either as [floating-point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic "Floating-point arithmetic") numbers or as small isolating [intervals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics) "Interval (mathematics)"), or [disks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_(mathematics) "Disk (mathematics)") for complex roots (an interval or disk output being equivalent to an approximate output together with an error bound).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-finding_algorithms#cite_note-1)

[Solving an equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_solving "Equation solving") _f_(_x_) = _g_(_x_) is the same as finding the roots of the function _h_(_x_) = _f_(_x_) – _g_(_x_). Thus root-finding algorithms allow solving any [equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_(mathematics) "Equation (mathematics)") defined by continuous functions. However, most root-finding algorithms do not guarantee that they will find all the roots; in particular, if such an algorithm does not find any root, that does not mean that no root exists.

Most numerical root-finding methods use [iteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration "Iteration"), producing a [sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence "Sequence") of numbers that hopefully converges towards the root as its [limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_of_a_sequence "Limit of a sequence"). They require one or more _initial guesses_ of the root as starting values, then each iteration of the algorithm produces a successively more accurate approximation to the root. Since the iteration must be stopped at some point, these methods produce an approximation to the root, not an exact solution. Many methods compute subsequent values by evaluating an auxiliary function on the preceding values. The limit is thus a [fixed point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_(mathematics) "Fixed point (mathematics)") of the auxiliary function, which is chosen for having the roots of the original equation as fixed points, and for converging rapidly to these fixed points.

The behavior of general root-finding algorithms is studied in [numerical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis "Numerical analysis"). However, for polynomials, root-finding study belongs generally to [computer algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra "Computer algebra"), since algebraic properties of polynomials are fundamental for the most efficient algorithms. The efficiency of an algorithm may depend dramatically on the characteristics of the given functions. For example, many algorithms use the [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative") of the input function, while others work on every [continuous function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function"). In general, numerical algorithms are not guaranteed to find all the roots of a function, so failing to find a root does not prove that there is no root. However, for [polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial"), there are specific algorithms that use algebraic properties for certifying that no root is missed, and locating the roots in separate intervals (or [disks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_(mathematics) "Disk (mathematics)") for complex roots) that are small enough to ensure the convergence of numerical methods (typically [Newton's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method "Newton's method")) to the unique root so located.
