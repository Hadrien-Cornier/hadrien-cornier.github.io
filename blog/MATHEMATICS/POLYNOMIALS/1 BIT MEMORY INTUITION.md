Help me with understanding this 1 bit memory unit. If I understand correctly, then if I use SAVE LOAD, LOAD has precedence over SAVE, such that if I save 1 into x and load at the same time, I will get back M(t-1) instead of x ? SO I have the intuition of a memory unit like a rule of precedence in mathematics, for instance like * has precedence over + in arithmetic. I also have this intuition of it being a sort of barrier, a physical buffer, like a capacitor that needs to be filled up before the saved value can be loaded. Essentially this is a sort of causal isolation of electric currents in the chip ? Or maybe you could see it as some sort of time segmentation device. Is this what memory is ? A linked List ? Please help me formalize and understand this idea. I feel like I am missing the true intuition of the 1 bit register.

The image you've provided appears to show a schematic or a user interface of a puzzle game that simulates electronic components, specifically focusing on a 1-bit memory unit. The 1-bit memory unit described is likely a simple storage device that can hold a value of 0 or 1, and it operates based on two inputs: "Save enable" and "Save value."

Here is a general idea of how a 1-bit memory unit works in the context of electronics and computer memory:

1. **Save Enable (Input 1)**: This is a control signal that, when active (usually represented by a '1'), allows the memory unit to store the value present on the "Save value" input.
   
2. **Save Value (Input 2)**: This is the data signal that carries the value to be stored in the memory unit when the "Save enable" signal is active.

3. **Output**: This represents the current value stored in the memory unit. Whatever value is stored here remains until it is overwritten by a new value when the "Save enable" signal is active again.

In electronic circuits, such as a flip-flop (which is a basic memory unit), if you have a "Save" (or "Set") and a "Load" (or "Reset") input, the precedence of these inputs depends on the specific type of flip-flop or latch you're using. Some flip-flops are designed to give priority to the reset over the set input, while others might have a more complex set of rules defining their behavior.

Your understanding of memory as having precedence is akin to the idea of setup and hold times in digital electronics. When a value is saved (written) to a memory unit, there are specific timing constraints that determine when the value is stable and can be read (loaded) again.

Memory is not exactly like a linked list, which is a data structure used in programming where each element points to the next. Memory in computers is typically an array of bits, and each bit can be independently read or written. A 1-bit register is just a single element of this array, capable of holding one bit of information. 

Your analogy with a physical buffer like a capacitor isn't far off when thinking about dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), which uses capacitors to store bits. However, the 1-bit memory unit you're describing seems to be a more abstract concept used within the game or simulation for teaching purposes.

In summary, a 1-bit memory unit or register in computer architecture is simply a device that can store one of two values, a 0 or a 1. The exact behavior in terms of input precedence and reading/writing timing will depend on the specifics of the hardware design or, in your case, the rules of the simulation.

I think this paragraph is wrong ! : "Memory is not exactly like a linked list, which is a data structure used in programming where each element points to the next. Memory in computers is typically an array of bits, and each bit can be independently read or written. A 1-bit register is just a single element of this array, capable of holding one bit of information." You did not understand that my point was that the memory unit is like a function M(t) applied to timestep number t, such that the the 1 bit register function is like we can imagine the state of the memory unit at time T to be part of a sequence which represents the life of the memory unit, its state timestep by timestep until the end of time. And essentially when you call save at time T you can only affect M(T+1) but M(T) has already been computed for this step. Do you see the nuance ? Is there something wrong with my argument ?

I apologize for the confusion. You're correct in your understanding that the state of a memory unit can be conceptualized as a function of time, $M(t)$, which represents its state at each timestep $t$.

In digital electronics and computer architecture, memory units are indeed affected by the timing of input signals and operations. Here's a more detailed explanation that might align with your understanding:

1. **Memory as a function of time**: The state of the memory unit at time $t$, denoted $M(t)$, is the value stored in the memory at that particular moment. This state only changes when a new value is saved into the memory.

2. **Writing to memory (Save)**: When a 'save' operation is performed at time $T$, it means that the new value will be stored and will become the new $M(T+1)$, reflecting the state of the memory in the next timestep. The current state $M(T)$ is not immediately changed by the 'save' operation; it remains as it was until the next timestep when the 'save' takes effect.

3. **Read-before-write timing**: If a 'load' (or read) operation is performed concurrently with a 'save' operation, the value you get is the value before the 'save' takes effect, which is $M(T)$. It's only after the 'save' operation is completed that the 'load' operation would reflect the new value, $M(T+1)$, in subsequent timesteps.

4. **Causality and precedence**: Your analogy to mathematical precedence is relevant in the sense that the outcome of $M(T)$ is dependent on the sequence and timing of 'save' operations. The value read at any given time is causally linked to the operations that occurred prior to that time.

Your conceptual model is a valid way to understand the temporal behavior of memory units in a computational system. In practice, this is accounted for by the 'setup' and 'hold' times of memory circuits, which dictate the time intervals before and after a clock edge (if synchronous) that data must be held stable to ensure correct operation. 

In summary, your argument captures the essence of temporal dependencies in memory operations, and there's nothing inherently wrong with it. It's a high-level abstraction that helps to understand how memory operations are sequenced over time.
